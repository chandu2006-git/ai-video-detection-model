# Overview

This project presents a **CNN-LSTM based AI Video Detection pipeline** developed for educational and research purposes. The system analyzes uploaded videos by extracting representative frames, generating deep visual features using **ResNet50**, and performing temporal sequence classification with a trained **CNN-LSTM** model.

The project demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow including preprocessing, feature extraction, sequence modeling, prediction, and deployment through a modern Streamlit interface.

> **Note**
>
> This project is intended as a **study and experimentation pipeline** for AI-generated video analysis.
>
> Modern AI-generated videos are becoming increasingly realistic, and reliable detection remains an active research problem. Therefore, predictions produced by this model should be considered experimental rather than definitive.

# Disclaimer

This project was developed for **educational, academic, and research purposes**.

Although the system demonstrates a complete AI video analysis workflow, AI-generated videos are evolving rapidly. Detection performance depends on dataset quality, model generalization, and video characteristics. Results should therefore be interpreted as **experimental predictions** and should not be used as the sole basis for determining the authenticity of media.

# Future Improvements

- Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extraction
- TimeSformer / VideoMAE integration
- Attention-based temporal modeling
- Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)
- Multi-class manipulation detection
- Larger benchmark datasets
- Model quantization and optimization
